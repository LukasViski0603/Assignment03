Queue Implementation and Algorithms
Project Description
This project implements three main components:

A template-based Queue data structure with basic operations
A recursive search algorithm for finding last occurrences
An insertion sort implementation for queues

# Requirements

Visual Studio 2022
C++ 14 or later

# File Structure

queue.h - Queue class template definition and implementation
recursive_search.h/cpp - Recursive last occurrence search implementation
insertion_sort.h/cpp - Queue-based insertion sort implementation
main.cpp - Test cases and program execution

# How to Run

Open Visual Studio 2022
Create a new empty C++ project
Add the provided source files to your project
Build and run the solution (F5)
